#Swagger

Swagger is the most popular framework for describing and documenting RESTful APIs.

- It gives a syntax which turns a single JSON file (or other formats, e.g. yaml) into a complete API specification.

- It is both human and machine-readible API documentation.
 
- It is fully open source and since 2011 hundreds of contributors took part in its evolution.

- Almost every modern programming language and deployment environment is now Swagger ready.

Sample service: The Petstore (see http://petstore.swagger.io)
